##SWMM++
This project is intended to model stormwater hydrology, hydraulics, and water quality similar to the EPA Stormwater Management Model (SWMM).

The intent is not to increase my own understanding of the theory and application of stormwater modeling as well as determine the feasible improvements to the EPA-SWMM codebase.
